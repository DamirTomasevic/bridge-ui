# Deploy a contract

This guide will help you deploy a smart contract to Taiko.

## Prerequisites

- You have testnet ETH on Taiko (to pay the transaction fee for deploying the contract).
  - You can [request Sepolia ETH](/docs/guides/receive-tokens#receive-sepolia-eth) from the faucet and then [use the bridge](/docs/guides/bridge-tokens) to send testnet ETH to Taiko.
- You have the private key to the account with testnet ETH on Taiko.

### Additional Remix prerequisites

- You have [setup your wallet](/docs/guides/setup-your-wallet) to connect to the relevant testnets.

      **1. Install Foundry**

      See the [Foundry installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

      **2. Create a project with Foundry**

      ```sh
      forge init hello_foundry && cd hello_foundry
      ```

      **3. Deploy your contract**

      Deploy the contract located at `src/Counter.sol`. Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` below with your private key which has some testnet ETH on Taiko.

      <Callout type="warning">
      Use a throwaway wallet to be safe. Don't reveal the private key of a wallet
      with significant value!
      </Callout>

      ```sh
      forge create --rpc-url https://rpc.jolnir.taiko.xyz --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY src/Counter.sol:Counter
      ```

      **4. View your contract**

      Paste the address from the output into the [Taiko block explorer](https://explorer.jolnir.taiko.xyz) and verify that the contract was deployed.

      **1. Create a project with Hardhat**

      ```sh
      npx hardhat
      ```

      **2. Add Taiko to your Hardhat config**
      <Callout type="warning">
      For the `accounts` array, you will need to enter the private key of the account you are deploying the contract with. It is **not recommended** to hardcode the private key like this (an environment variable would be better, but is still risky).

      Use a throwaway wallet to be safe. Don't reveal the private key of a wallet with significant value!
      </Callout>

      ```ts {6-13} filename=hardhat.config.ts
      import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
      import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";

      const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
         solidity: "0.8.18",
         networks: {
            taiko: {
               url: "https://rpc.jolnir.taiko.xyz",
               accounts: [
                  "0xf214f2b2cd398c806f84e317254e0f0b801d0643303237d97a22a48e01628897",
               ],
            },
         },
      };

      export default config;
      ```

      **3. Deploy your contract on Taiko**

      ```sh
      npx hardhat run --network taiko scripts/deploy.ts
      ```

      **4. View your contract**
      Paste the address from the output into the Taiko block explorer and verify that the contract was deployed.

      **1. Visit Remix and connect your wallet to Taiko**
      Visit [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org) and connect your wallet to Taiko.

      **2. Select a smart contract**

      **3. Compile your smart contract**

      **4. Deploy your smart contract**

      **1. Deploy your smart contract using deploy**
      
      Navigate to the root directory of your project and execute the following command:

      ```bash
      npx thirdweb deploy
      ```

      Executing this command will trigger the following actions:

      - Compiling all the contracts in the current directory.
      - Providing the option to select which contract(s) you wish to deploy.
      - Uploading your contract source code (ABI) to IPFS.

      **2. Open the dashboard interface**

      When it is completed, it will open a dashboard interface to finish filling out the parameters.

      - `_name`: contract name
      - `_symbol`: symbol or "ticker"
      - `_royaltyRecipient`: wallet address to receive royalties from secondary sales
      - `_royaltyBps`: basis points (bps) that will be given to the royalty recipient for each secondary sale, e.g. 500 = 5%

      **3. Select `Taiko (Alpha-3 Testnet)` as the network**

      **4. Manage additional settings on your contract’s dashboard**

      You can manage settings as needed such as for uploading NFTs, configuring permissions, and more.
