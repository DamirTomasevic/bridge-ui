# Run a Taiko node

This guide will help you start up a Taiko RPC node using [simple-taiko-node](https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and **running**.
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git/) is installed.
- Meet the [Geth minimum hardware requirements](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#hardware-requirements) except for the storage requirement because Taiko nodes will require less storage. As of `2023-09-18` a node uses less than **10 GB**. **100 GB** should be future proof enough if you intend to run your node for a while.

## Steps

<Steps>
### Clone simple-taiko-node

  <Tab>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node.git
cd simple-taiko-node
```

  </Tab>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node.git
cd simple-taiko-node
git config core.autocrlf false
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Copy the sample .env files

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

### Set the required values in the .env file

**First**, open the `.env` in your preferred text editor:

```sh
nano .env
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```sh
notepad .env
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Next**, you will set the L1 archive node endpoints.

<Callout>
You can get a L1 endpoint from a few places, but it **must point to an archive node** to access the state trie beyond the last 128 blocks.

**Recommended**:
Run your own Sepolia archive node, see: [Run a Sepolia node](/docs/guides/run-a-sepolia-node). This is recommended because you will eventually be rate-limited by public RPC providers.

**Alternative**:
[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) and [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) are two popular RPC providers. Make sure you select the RPC as Sepolia testnet, and not Ethereum mainnet.

</Callout>

  If you are running a local Sepolia node, you cannot reference the L1 endpoints as `http://127.0.0.1:8545` and `ws://127.0.0.1:8546` because that is local to inside the simple-taiko-node Docker image. Depending on your firewall setup, you can do a few things. You can try:
  - Using `host.docker.internal` (see: [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319662))
  - Using the private ip address of your machine (use something like `ip addr show` to get this ip address)

  First, sign in to [Alchemy's dashboard](https://www.alchemy.com/).
  ![Alchemy dashboard sign in](/images/guides/alchemy/sign-in.png)
  
  Then, go to "Create App".
  ![dashboard click create app](/images/guides/alchemy/dashboard.png)

Next, configure your app:

- for "name", enter "Taiko A3 Node", or your preferred name.
- for "chain", select "Ethereum".
- for "network", select "Ethereum Sepolia".

Then, click the "Create app" button.
![create an Alchemy app](/images/guides/alchemy/create-app.png)

After, go to "Dashboard", and click "view key".

You should see `https://eth-sepolia...` and `wss://eth-sepolia...`. Copy both endpoints.

These are your `L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP` and `L1_ENDPOINT_WS` on your `.env`.

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  First, sign in to [Infura's dashboard](https://www.infura.io/).
  ![Infura dashboard sign in](/images/guides/infura/sign-in.png)

Next, go to "API Keys", and click the "create new API key" button:

- for "network", select "Web3 API".
- for "name", enter "Taiko A3 Node", or your preferred name.

Then, click the "create" button.
![create API key](/images/guides/infura/create-key.png)

You should be redirected to your app's page.

Then go to "Endpoints", and select "Sepolia". Copy the `https://sepolia.infura...` endpoint.

This is your `L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP` on your `.env`.
![get HTTPS endpoints](/images/guides/infura/https-endpoints.png)

Next, go to "WebSockets", and copy the `wss://sepolia.infura...` endpoint.

This is your `L1_ENDPOINT_WS` on your `.env`.
![get WSS endpoints](/images/guides/infura/wss-endpoints.png)

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Finally**, set the following L1 node endpoints in your `.env` file:

- `L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP`
- `L1_ENDPOINT_WS`

Take a look at the comments above these values in the `.env.sample` to see how to set them up.

### Start a node

Make sure Docker is running and then run the following command to start the node:

```sh
sudo docker compose up -d
```

### Verify node is running

#### Check with the node dashboard

A node dashboard will be running on `localhost` on the `GRAFANA_PORT` you set in your `.env` file, which defaults to `3001`: [http://localhost:3001/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview](http://localhost:3001/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview).

<br />
<Image
  src="/images/guides/node-dashboard.png"
  alt="taiko node dashboard"
  width={2539}
  height={1106}
/>

You can verify that your node is syncing by checking that the **chain head** on the dashboard (see above) is increasing. Once the chain head matches what's on the block explorer, you are fully synced.

#### Check with curl commands

1. Check if the Execution Layer client is connected to Taiko L2:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8547 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

which should return the chainId as `0x28c5f` (167007):

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": "0x28c5f" }
```

2. Check if the Execution Layer client is synced by requesting the latest Taiko L2 / L3 block from the Execution Layer client:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8547 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

3. If the blockNumber response value is `0` or not growing, check the Taiko L2 logs here:

```bash
sudo docker compose logs -f
```

### Operate the node

You can find all node operations (eg. stop node, update node, remove node, view logs) in the [Node runner manual](/docs/manuals/node-runner-manual).

## Videos

{/* TODO(docs): add new video for L2 node running below */}

- [Run a Taiko L2 node (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_tVvDcuK5o) (deprecated, but still useful)

## Troubleshooting

- View the [Node troubleshooting reference](/docs/reference/node-troubleshooting) for help on any common error codes / issues.
- View the logs of the node (see all log commands in the [Node runner manual](/docs/manuals/node-runner-manual)).
