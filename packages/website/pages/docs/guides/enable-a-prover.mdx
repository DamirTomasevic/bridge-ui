<Callout>
 Only the first prover can get the reward, and others will be rejected by the protocol smart contract. This means the fastest prover will be able to prove the block and earn the reward, **if you have just the minimum hardware outlined in the prerequisited below, it's unlikely you will be able to prove any blocks if there are many other high-performance provers**.
</Callout>


## Prerequisites
- Must have some ETH on Sepolia (see [receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).
- Should have at least 8/16 core CPU and 32GB of RAM. (**note: see warning above**)


## Steps

<Steps>
### Set environment variables to enable prover
Set the following environment variables to enable your node as a prover: 
    - Set `ENABLE_PROVER` to `true` (replacing the default `false` with `true`). 
    - Set `L1_PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY` to that of your wallet's private key; it will need some balance on Sepolia to prove blocks (if using MetaMask, follow these directions to [retrieve the private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key)).

### Verify prover logs
Verify you have some prover logs:
    - `ðŸ’° Your block proof was accepted` means you are the first prover and receive the reward.
    - `âœ… Valid block proven` just means a proposed block was successfully proved on TaikoL1 (by anyone).
</Steps>

Consult [Run a node - Troubleshooting](/docs/guides/run-a-node#troubleshooting) for common issues.
