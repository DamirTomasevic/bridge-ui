# Enable a prover

This guide will help you enable your Taiko node as a prover. Read more about the proof design [here](/docs/concepts/proving).

## Prerequisites

- You have already setup a node (see: [Run a node](/docs/guides/run-a-node)).
- A balance of ETH and TTKOj on Sepolia L1 (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).
- At least 8/16 core CPU and 32GB of RAM.

## Steps

<Steps>
### Open the .env file in `simple-taiko-node`

```sh
nano .env
```

### Set environment variables to enable prover

<Callout type="error">
  Do **not** use a private key that is valuable to you. The private key will be
  stored in plain text in the `.env` file, and this is not secure. There is a
  real risk of losing your assets. You should **only use a test account**.

  To generate an isolated burner wallet locally:

  <Tabs items={["foundry", "ethers.js"]} defaultIndex="0">
    <Tab>
        ```shell
        cast wallet new | tee /dev/tty | 
        grep 'Private key:' | awk '{print "export PRIVATE_KEY="$3}' >> .env && source .env
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```js
      var ethers = require('ethers');  
      var crypto = require('crypto');

      var id = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
      var privateKey = "0x"+id;
      console.log("SAVE BUT DO NOT SHARE THIS:", privateKey);

      var wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey);
      console.log("Address: " + wallet.address);
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs> 
</Callout>

Open the `.env` file and set the following environment variables to enable your node as a prover:

<Callout type="error">
  For `L1_PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY` 
  make sure your private key is in hexadecimal format and with the `0x` prefix removed!
  Otherwise you will get this error in your prover status logs:
  ```
  simple-taiko-node-taiko_client_prover_relayer-1  | invalid L1 prover private key: invalid length, need 256 bits
  ```
</Callout>

- Set `ENABLE_PROVER` to `true`
- Set `L1_PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY` to your L1 account private key (with balance of TTKOj on TaikoL1), we will the public key of this account in the next Steps

### Approve TaikoL1 as TTKOj spender

You will need TTKOj deposited on the TaikoL1 contract to secure the bond for the proofs you generate.

First, you will need to **approve the TaikoL1 contract as a spender**. Visit the TTKOj contract on Sepolia [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x75F94f04d2144cB6056CCd0CFF1771573d838974#writeProxyContract).

Next, click the **Connect to Web3** button.

Next, click the **approve** function and set the spender address to the TaikoL1 contract address: `0x95fF8D3CE9dcB7455BEB7845143bEA84Fe5C4F6f`.

Next, set the amount to at least the minimum bond amount of 2.5 TTKOj. You will need 2.5 TTKOj for each bond you sign. After entering 2.5, you need to set the 18 decimals that the TTKOj contract takes, you can click the plus button and then select 10^18.

Finally, click the **Write** button.

### Deposit TTKOj to TaikoL1

Visit the TaikoL1 contract [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x95fF8D3CE9dcB7455BEB7845143bEA84Fe5C4F6f#writeProxyContract).

Next, click the **Connect to Web3** button.

Next, click the **depositTaikoToken** function.

Next, set the amount to at least the minimum bond amount of 2.5 TTKOj. You will need 2.5 TTKOj for each bond you sign. After entering 2.5, you need to set the 18 decimals that the TTKOj contract takes, you can click the plus button and then select 10^18.

Finally, click the **Write** button.

> Note: If you were already running a prover from your address when you approved TaikoL1 as a spender, the contract may directly drain up to the approved amount of TTKOj from your wallet to use as bond for proving. This may cause `depositTaikoToken` transactions to fail.

### Check prover status logs

To see if your prover is running correctly or has errors run:

```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_prover_relayer
```

### Verify prover logs

When you run:

```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_prover_relayer | egrep "block proof was|proof submission error|Block proven"
```

if your prover has successfully proven a block, your logs should show:

- `üí∞ Your block proof was accepted` means you successfully submitted a proof and your bond is returned.
- `‚úÖ Block proven` means a proposed block was successfully proved on TaikoL1 (by anyone).

You can check all commands to see prover logs in the [node runner manual](/docs/manuals/node-runner-manual#view-client-prover-relayer-logs).

### Register your prover (optionally)

Add your prover to the [prover registration page](/docs/reference/prover-market-page) so that other block proposers can find your prover and request bonds.

</Steps>

## Tokenomics

When a prover receives a block from a proposer, the prover must bond TTKOj tokens to the TaikoL1 contract. 
Once TTKOj is bonded, a countdown is started to prove the block. 

‚úÖ If the prover is successful in proving the block in time, the prover will receive their bond back with additional TTKOj rewards.

‚ùå If the prover fails to prove a block in time, part of their bonded TTKOj will be slashed.
Then a new prover will be given the chance to prove that block with the remaining TTKOj that wasn't slashed.

üõí A prover market has been added with testnet Jolnir.
This gives proposers the ability to pick provers based on:
```
-fees paid in ETH 
-competitive proving speed (reported from community reputation)
```
