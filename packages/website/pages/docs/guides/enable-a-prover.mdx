# Enable a prover

This guide will help you enable your Taiko node as a prover. Read more about prover dynamics [here](/docs/concepts/proving#prover-dynamics).

## Prerequisites

- You have already setup a node (see: [Run a node](/docs/guides/run-a-node)).
- Must have a balance of ETH on Sepolia L1 (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).
- Should have at least 8/16 core CPU and 32GB of RAM.

## Steps

<Steps>
### Open the .env file in `simple-taiko-node`

```sh
nano .env
```

### Set environment variables to enable prover

<Callout type="warning">
  Do **not** use a private key that is valuable to you. The private key will be
  stored in plain text in the `.env` and this is not secure. There is a real
  risk of losing your assets. You should **only use a test account**.
</Callout>

Open the `.env` file and set the following environment variables to enable your node as a prover:

- Set `ENABLE_PROVER` to `true`
- Set `L1_PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY` to your L1 account private key (with balance of TTKOj on TaikoL1), we will the public key of this account in the next Steps

### Approve TaikoL1 as TTKOj spender

You will need TTKOj deposited on the TaikoL1 contract to secure the bond for the proofs you generate.

First, you will need to **approve the TaikoL1 contract as a spender**. Visit the TTKOj contract on Sepolia [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x75F94f04d2144cB6056CCd0CFF1771573d838974#writeProxyContract).

Next, click the **Connect to Web3** button.

Next, click the **approve** function and set the spender address to the TaikoL1 contract address: `0x95fF8D3CE9dcB7455BEB7845143bEA84Fe5C4F6f`.

Next, set the amount to at least the minimum bond amount of 2.5 TTKOj. You will need 2.5 TTKOj for each bond you sign. After entering 2.5, you need to set the 18 decimals that the TTKOj contract takes, you can click the plus button and then select 10^18.

Finally, click the **Write** button.

### Deposit TTKOj to TaikoL1

Visit the TaikoL1 contract [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x95fF8D3CE9dcB7455BEB7845143bEA84Fe5C4F6f#writeProxyContract).

Next, click the **Connect to Web3** button.

Next, click the **depositTaikoToken** function.

Next, set the amount to at least the minimum bond amount of 2.5 TTKOj. You will need 2.5 TTKOj for each bond you sign. After entering 2.5, you need to set the 18 decimals that the TTKOj contract takes, you can click the plus button and then select 10^18.

Finally, click the **Write** button.

### Verify prover logs

Run this command to verify you have some prover logs:

```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_prover_relayer | egrep "block proof was|proof submission error|Block proven"
```

You should see logs like this if it was successful:

- `ðŸ’° Your block proof was accepted` means you successfully submitted a proof and your bond is returned.
- `âœ… Block proven` means a proposed block was successfully proved on TaikoL1 (by anyone).

You can check all commands to see prover logs in the [node runner manual](/docs/manuals/node-runner-manual#view-client-prover-relayer-logs).

### Register your prover (optionally)

Add your prover to the [prover registration page](/docs/reference/prover-market-page) so that other block proposers can find your prover and request bonds.
