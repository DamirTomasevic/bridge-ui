# Enable a proposer

This guide will help you enable your Taiko node as a proposer.

## Prerequisites

- You have already setup a node (see: [Run a node](/docs/guides/run-a-node))

### Grimsvotn L2

- Must have a balance of ETH and TTKO on Sepolia L1 (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

### Eldfell L3

- Must have a balance of ETH and TTKOe on Grimsvotn L2 (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

## Steps

<Steps>
### Visit the TaikoL1 contract on block explorer

First, you need to visit the `TaikoL1` **proxy contract**:

- If you are depositing **TTKO**, you can visit it <StyledLink href={contractAddressToLink(SEPOLIA_CONFIG.blockExplorer.url, SEPOLIA_CONFIG.basedContracts.taikoL1.address.proxy)} text="here" />.
- If you are depositing **TTKOe**, you can visit it <StyledLink href={contractAddressToLink(GRIMSVOTN_CONFIG.blockExplorer.url, GRIMSVOTN_CONFIG.basedContracts.taikoL1.address.proxy)} text="here" />.

### Click the write proxy tab

Then, visit the "Write proxy" (Blockscout) or "Write as proxy" (Etherscan) tab.

Click the wallet connect button on the explorer.

### Enter deposit amount

Click the text field for `depositTaikoToken` and enter the amount of TTKO or TTKOe you would like to deposit followed by 8 zeroes.

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to click the plus sign and click `10^8` decimals to add 8 zeroes, or
  add 8 zeroes manually.
</Callout>

For example if you want to deposit `69` TTKO/TTKOe, you would enter `6900000000`.

<Callout type="note">
  For accurate deposit amounts, refer to "Block Fee" on the L2/L3 Protocol
  Status page (see: [L2 Protocol Status](https://status.test.taiko.xyz), [L3
  Protocol Status](https://explorer.l3test.taiko.xyz/stats)). Insufficient
  deposits may result in proposal failure.
</Callout>

### Deposit your TTKO/TTKOe

Click `Write` and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

### Open .env file in `simple-taiko-node`

For Grimsvotn L2:
```sh
nano .env
```

For Eldfell L3:

```sh
nano .env.l3
```

### Set environment variables to enable a proposer

<Callout type="warning">
  Do **not** use a private key that is valuable to you. The private key will be
  stored in plain text in the `.env` or `.env.l3` file, and this is not secure.
  There is a real risk of losing your assets. You should **only use a test
  account**.
</Callout>

Set the following environment variables to enable your node as a proposer:

For Grimsvotn L2 `.env`:

```sh
ENABLE_PROPOSER=true # change from false to true
# A L1 account (with balance) private key who will send TaikoL1.proposeBlock transactions
L1_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 # your wallet's private key
# A L2 account address who will be the tx fee beneficiary of the L2 blocks that you proposed
L2_SUGGESTED_FEE_RECIPIENT=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 # the recipient of L2/L3 ETH rewards.
```

For Eldfell L3 `.env.l3`:

```sh
ENABLE_PROPOSER=true # change from false to true
# A L2 account (with balance) private key who will send TaikoL1.proposeBlock transactions
L2_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 # your wallet's private key
# A L3 account address who will be the tx fee beneficiary of the L3 blocks that you proposed
L3_SUGGESTED_FEE_RECIPIENT=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 # the recipient of L2/L3 ETH rewards.
```

### Verify proposer logs

You should see a log if you have proposed a block: `üìù Propose transactions succeeded`.

You can check all commands to see proposer logs in the [node runner manual](/docs/manuals/node-runner-manual#view-client-proposer-logs).
