# Enable a proposer

This guide will help you enable your Taiko node as a proposer.

## Prerequisites

- You have already setup a node (see: [Run a node](/docs/guides/run-a-node))

### Grimsvotn L2

- Must have a balance of ETH and TTKO on Sepolia L1 (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

### Eldfell L3

- Must have a balance of ETH and TTKOe on Grimsvotn L2 (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

## Steps

<Steps>
### Visit the TaikoL1 contract on block explorer

Navigate to the TaikoL1 contract on the block explorer (see contract addresses [here](/docs/reference/contract-addresses)).

Then, visit the "read contract" tab.

Click the wallet connect button on the explorer.

### Enter deposit amount

Click `depositTaikoToken` and enter the amount of TTKO/TTKOe you would like to deposit followed by 8 zeroes.

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to click the plus sign and add `10^8` decimals, or add 8 zeroes
  manually.
</Callout>

For example if you want to deposit `69` TTKO/TTKOe, you would enter `6900000000`.

### Deposit your TTKO/TTKOe

Click `Write` and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

### Open `.env` file in `simple-taiko-node`

Open the `.env` file in the `simple-taiko-node` directory.

### Set environment variables to enable a proposer

Set the following environment variables to enable your node as a proposer:

- Set `ENABLE_PROPOSER` to `true` (replacing the default `false` with `true`).
- Set `L1_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY` to that of your wallet's private key; it will need some TTKO/TTKOe on Sepolia/Grimsvotn to propose blocks (if using MetaMask, follow these directions to [retrieve the private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key)).
- Set `L2_SUGGESTED_FEE_RECIPIENT` to the recipient of L2/L3 ETH rewards.

### Verify proposer logs

You should see a log if you have proposed a block: `üìù Propose transactions succeeded`.

If you are running a node in the background, you can view the logs with `docker compose logs -f`.
