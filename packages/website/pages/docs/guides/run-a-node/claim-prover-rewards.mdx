# Claim prover rewards

This guide will help you claim TTKO/TTKOe earned as a prover.

## Prerequisites

- You followed the [Enable a prover](/docs/guides/enable-a-prover) guide and have a prover which has proved a block to earn TTKO/TTKOe rewards.
- Must have a balance of ETH Sepolia (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

## Steps

<Steps>

### View TTKO/TTKOe prover address balance

Go to the TaikoL1 contract read page (see contract addresses [here](/docs/reference/contract-addresses)) and select `getTaikoTokenBalance(addr address)` to lookup your TTKO/TTKOe claim balance for your prover's address.

### Enter withdraw amount

Switch to the contract write page and select `withdrawTaikoToken(amount uint256)` to withdraw TTKO/TTKOe balances earned from being a prover.
