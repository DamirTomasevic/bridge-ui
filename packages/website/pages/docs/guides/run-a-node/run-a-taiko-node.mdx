# Run a Taiko node

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of operating a Taiko node via [simple-taiko-node](https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node). You will be able to:

- Run a Taiko node easily from the command line on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- View a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard which displays the node's status.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and **running**.
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git/) is installed.
- Consult the [Geth minimum hardware requirements](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#hardware-requirements), but ignore the storage requirement as Taiko nodes will require less storage. Around 50GB should be more than enough initially, but over time it could become insufficient as the chain grows. As of `2023-06-21T16:59:11+00:00` a Taiko node sync takes **17.3 GB**.

## Steps

### Configure your node (required)

First, copy the `.env.sample` to a new file `.env`:

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

Next, open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor:

  ```sh
  nano .env

  <Tab>
  ```sh
  vim .env
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```sh
  notepad .env
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then, configure your Sepolia L1 endpoint.

<Callout>
  You can get a Sepolia L1 endpoint from a few places, but it **must point to an archive node** to access the state trie beyond the last 128 blocks.

  **Recommended**:
  Run your own Sepolia archive node, see: [Run a Sepolia node](/docs/guides/run-a-sepolia-node). This is recommended because you will eventually be rate-limited by public RPC providers.

  **Alternative**:
  [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) and [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) are two popular RPC providers. Make sure you select the RPC as Sepolia testnet, and not Ethereum mainnet.
</Callout>

  <Tab>
  If you are running a local Sepolia node, you cannot reference the L1 endpoints as `http://127.0.0.1:8545` and `ws://127.0.0.1:8546` because that is local to inside the simple-taiko-node Docker image. Depending on your firewall setup, you can do a few things. You can try:
  - Using `host.docker.internal` (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319662)
  - Using the local ip address of your machine (use something like `ip addr show` to get the ip address)

  First, sign in to [Alchemy's dashboard](https://www.alchemy.com/).
  ![Alchemy dashboard sign in](/images/guides/alchemy/sign-in.png)
  
  Then, go to "Create App".
  ![dashboard click create app](/images/guides/alchemy/dashboard.png)

  Next, configure your app:
  - for "name", enter "Taiko A3 Node", or your preferred name. 
  - for "chain", select "Ethereum". 
  - for "network", select "Ethereum Sepolia".

  Then, click the "Create app" button.

  Next, go to "API Keys", and click the "create new API key" button:
  - for "network", select "Web3 API". 
  - for "name", enter "Taiko A3 Node", or your preferred name. 

  Then, click the "create" button.
  ![create API key](/images/guides/infura/create-key.png)

  You should be redirected to your app's page. 

  Then go to "Endpoints", and select "Sepolia". Copy the `https://sepolia.infura...` endpoint. 
  
  This is your `L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP` on your `.env`.
  ![get HTTPS endpoints](/images/guides/infura/https-endpoints.png)

  Next, go to "WebSockets", and copy the `wss://sepolia.infura...` endpoint.

  This is your `L1_ENDPOINT_WS` on your `.env`.
  ![get WSS endpoints](/images/guides/infura/wss-endpoints.png)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Finally, set the following environment variables:

- L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP
- L1_ENDPOINT_WS

### Enable your node as a proposer (optional)

See [enable a proposer](/docs/guides/enable-a-proposer) for more information.


### Enable your node as a prover (optional)

See [enable a prover](/docs/guides/enable-a-prover) for more information.

### Start a node

<Callout>
  If you ran a testnet node previously make sure to first run a `docker compose down -v` to remove the old volumes. Also, it may take some time to synchronize from the genesis block. You can monitor this progress through logs, or in the local grafana dashboard and see the latest L2 chain status in the [Taiko block explorer](https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz/).
</Callout>

Make sure Docker is running and then run the following command to start the node. If you want to run it in the background, please add the `-d` flag (`docker compose up -d`).

```sh
docker compose up
```

To run the node in the background (detached mode), use the `-d` flag:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### Stop a node

This command shuts down the node, but will keep all volumes, so next time you restart the node, it won't need to synchronize from the genesis again.

```sh
docker compose down
```

### Remove a node

These commands will completely remove the node by removing all volumes used by each container:

```sh
docker compose down -v
rm -f .env
```

### Update a node

Update the `simple-taiko-node` Docker images:

```sh
docker compose pull
```

### View the node's logs

To view the Docker logs, the following commands can be ran:

#### View all logs

```sh
docker compose logs -f
```

#### View the proposer image's logs

```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_proposer
```

#### View the prover image's logs

```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_prover_relayer
```

#### View the L2 execution engine logs

```sh
docker compose logs -f l2_execution_engine
```

#### View the live data streams of your running containers
This shows the CPU/MEM USAGE % and consumption of your machine's resources (add prefix "`docker stats -a`" to display all containers)
```sh
docker stats
```

### View the node's status dashboard  

A [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard with a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) datasource is also included to display the L2 execution engine's real time status.

You can visit it at [http://localhost:3000/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview](http://localhost:3000/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview).

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Node warning logs
You can ignore any WARN logs.

### Node error logs

#### `error: "failed to insert new head to L2 execution engine: missing trie node"`
Make sure that your RPC is pointing to an Sepolia archive node, and not a full node.

#### `error: "daily request count exceeded, request rate limited"`
Your RPC provider has a limit on the number of requests. You can try using a different provider that offers higher limits.

#### `error: L1_BLOCK_ID`
The block that you want to prove has already been verified, you can ignore this.

#### `error: L1_ALREADY_PROVEN`
This block has been proven by someone else, but it's not verified yet, you can ignore it.

#### `Fatal: Failed to register the Ethereum service: database contains incompatible genesis`
Try to remove the node with `docker compose down -v` and then try again.

#### `Unhandled trie error: missing trie node`
You can ignore this error, it doesn't affect you and goes away after a while.

#### `Block batch iterator callback error; error="failed to fetch L2 parent block: not found`
You can ignore this error.

#### `Error starting ...: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:{port} bind: address already in use`
The port is already in use by another service. You can either shut down the other program or change the port in the .env file.

#### `error parsing HTTP 403 response body: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value`
Your IP address is being geo-blocked due to sanctions lists. If you're affected, try changing hosting locations or utilize a VPN to change your IP address.

#### `ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because: Unsupported config option for some_service 'pull_policy'`
Your docker installation is out of date. You need to update your docker compose installation: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/.

#### `daemon docker is not running` <br></br> `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`
Need to start the Docker before running the commands.

#### `database contains incompatible genesis`
If you ran an alpha-1 testnet node make sure to first run a docker compose down -v to remove the old volumes.

#### `Bind for 0.0.0.0:port` failed: port already allocated
This error just means that the port taiko-node is trying to allocate is already being used by either some other node you're running
or by a left-over container of taiko node if you did not close down the node correctly, you can try running `docker compose down` in the simple-taiko-node folder and start it again using `docker compose up -d`
or edit the `.env` and replace the problematic port with a different one.

#### `Failed to fetch L1Origin from L2 execution engine <br></br> err="not found"`
This seems to be a common issue if you're using Alchemy endpoints, switching to Infura should fix this issue.

#### `no configuration file provided: not found`
You are in the wrong directory, `cd simple-taiko-node` and run the command again.

#### `unknown shorthand flag: 'd' in -d`
You are using v1 of docker-compose, use the command: `docker-compose up -d` instead of `docker compose up -d`, I highly recommend that you upgrade to the v2 of docker compose plugin [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)

#### `docker: 'compose' is not a docker command`
You are missing the docker compose plugin [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)

#### `taiko_client_prover_relayer not printing any logs`
There could be several reasons, you can check the logs `docker compose logs -f` to make sure there are no errors but one of the most common cause for this is a typo in the `.env` file
`ENABLE_PROVER=True/TRUE` when setting this to true `true` has to be in all lowercase or the script to start relayer won't run.

#### `simple-taiko-node-taiko_client_prover_relayer-1  | /bin/sh: /script/start-prover-relayer.sh: not found`
This issue occurs on windows because of the Control Characters in this case the Line Endings, a quick fix would be to delete the node folder, run this `git config --global core.autocrlf false` in the shell, then clone the repo again.

If you do not want to delete the node folder, please follow one of these steps below.
