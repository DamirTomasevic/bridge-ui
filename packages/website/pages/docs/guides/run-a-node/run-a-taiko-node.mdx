# Run a Taiko node

This guide will walk you through the process of operating a Taiko node via [simple-taiko-node](https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node). You will be able to:

- Run a Taiko node easily from the command line on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- View a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard which displays the node's status.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and **running**.
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git/) is installed.
- Consult the [Geth minimum hardware requirements](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#hardware-requirements), but ignore the storage requirement as Taiko nodes will require less storage. Around 50GB should be more than enough initially, but over time it could become insufficient as the chain grows. As of `2023-06-21T16:59:11+00:00` a Taiko node sync takes **17.3 GB**.

## Steps

git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node.git
cd simple-taiko-node
```

  </Tab>

### Configure your node (required)

To run a Grimsvotn L2 node:

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

To run a Eldfell L3 node:

```sh
cp .env.sample.l3 .env.l3
```

We will refer to `.env.l3` as `.env` for the purpose of this guide.

Next, open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor:

```sh
nano .env
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```sh
notepad .env
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then, configure your base layer endpoint. This would be a Sepolia L1 RPC to run a Grimsvotn L2 node, and a Grimsvotn L2 RPC to run an Eldfell L3 node.

<Callout>
  You can get a base layer endpoint from a few places, but it **must point to an archive node** to access the state trie beyond the last 128 blocks.

**Recommended**:
Run your own Sepolia archive node, see: [Run a Sepolia node](/docs/guides/run-a-sepolia-node). This is recommended because you will eventually be rate-limited by public RPC providers. If you are running an Elfell L3 node, you will need to have a fully synced Grimsvotn L2 node.

**Alternative**:
[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) and [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) are two popular RPC providers. Make sure you select the RPC as Sepolia testnet, and not Ethereum mainnet.

</Callout>

  If you are running a local Sepolia node, you cannot reference the L1 endpoints as `http://127.0.0.1:8545` and `ws://127.0.0.1:8546` because that is local to inside the simple-taiko-node Docker image. Depending on your firewall setup, you can do a few things. You can try:
  - Using `host.docker.internal` (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319662)
  - Using the local ip address of your machine (use something like `ip addr show` to get the ip address)

  First, sign in to [Alchemy's dashboard](https://www.alchemy.com/).
  ![Alchemy dashboard sign in](/images/guides/alchemy/sign-in.png)
  
  Then, go to "Create App".
  ![dashboard click create app](/images/guides/alchemy/dashboard.png)

Next, configure your app:

- for "name", enter "Taiko A3 Node", or your preferred name.
- for "chain", select "Ethereum".
- for "network", select "Ethereum Sepolia".

Then, click the "Create app" button.
![create an Alchemy app](/images/guides/alchemy/create-app.png)

After, go to "Dashboard", and click "view key".

You should see `https://eth-sepolia...` and `wss://eth-sepolia...`. Copy both endpoints.

These are your `L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP` and `L1_ENDPOINT_WS` on your `.env`.

  <Tab>
  First, sign in to [Infura's dashboard](https://www.infura.io/).
  ![Infura dashboard sign in](/images/guides/infura/sign-in.png)

Next, go to "API Keys", and click the "create new API key" button:

- for "network", select "Web3 API".
- for "name", enter "Taiko A3 Node", or your preferred name.

Then, click the "create" button.
![create API key](/images/guides/infura/create-key.png)

You should be redirected to your app's page.

Then go to "Endpoints", and select "Sepolia". Copy the `https://sepolia.infura...` endpoint.

This is your `L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP` on your `.env`.
![get HTTPS endpoints](/images/guides/infura/https-endpoints.png)

Next, go to "WebSockets", and copy the `wss://sepolia.infura...` endpoint.

This is your `L1_ENDPOINT_WS` on your `.env`.
![get WSS endpoints](/images/guides/infura/wss-endpoints.png)

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Finally, set the following environment variables:

- L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP
- L1_ENDPOINT_WS

### Enable your node as a proposer (optional)

See [enable a proposer](/docs/guides/enable-a-proposer) for more information.

### Enable your node as a prover (optional)

See [enable a prover](/docs/guides/enable-a-prover) for more information.

### Start a node

<Callout type="info">
  Keep in mind that for a Grimsvotn L2 node you will use `docker compose` for
  all commands, and for an Eldfell L3 node you will use `docker compose -f
  ./docker-compose.l3.yml --env-file .env.l3` for all commands.
</Callout>

Make sure Docker is running and then run the following command to start the node. If you want to run it in the background, please add the `-d` flag (`docker compose up -d`).

For a Grimsvotn L2 node:

```sh
docker compose up
```

For a Eldfell L3 node:

```sh
docker compose -f ./docker-compose.l3.yml --env-file .env.l3 up
```

To run the node in the background (detached mode), use the `-d` flag:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### Stop a node

This command shuts down the node, but will keep all volumes, so next time you restart the node, it won't need to synchronize from the genesis again.

```sh
docker compose down
```

### Remove a node

These commands will completely remove the node by removing all volumes used by each container:

```sh
docker compose down -v
rm -f .env
```

### Update a node

Update the `simple-taiko-node` Docker images:

```sh
docker compose pull
```

### View the node's logs

To view the Docker logs, the following commands can be ran:

#### View all L2 logs

```sh
docker compose logs -f
```

#### View the L2 proposer image's logs

```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_proposer
```

#### View the L2 prover image's logs

```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_prover_relayer
```

#### View the L2 execution engine logs

```sh
docker compose logs -f l2_execution_engine
```

#### View all L3 logs

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.l3.yml logs -f
```

#### View the L3 proposer image's logs

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.l3.yml logs -f l3_taiko_client_proposer
```

#### View the L3 prover image's logs

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.l3.yml logs -f l3_taiko_client_prover_relayer
```

#### View the L3 execution engine logs

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.l3.yml logs -f l3_execution_engine
```

#### View the live data streams of your running containers

This shows the CPU/MEM USAGE % and consumption of your machine's resources (add prefix "`docker stats -a`" to display all containers)

```sh
docker stats
```

### View the node's status dashboard

A [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard with a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) datasource is also included to display the L2 execution engine's real time status.

You can visit it at [http://localhost:3000/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview](http://localhost:3000/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview).
