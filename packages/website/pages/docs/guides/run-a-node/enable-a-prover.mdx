<Callout type="warning">
  Keep in mind that running a prover is a very competitive space, and those who
  generate proofs will have very powerful machines and optimized clients. It's
  unlikely to prove a block and gain rewards with the default client and minimum
  hardware requirements (e.g. even a i9-13900K is not fast enough to prove for Grimsvotn L2).

# Enable a prover

This guide will help you enable your Taiko node as a prover. Your node will generate proofs, but this does not mean you will be able to submit a proof in time to earn a reward, see the warning above. Read more about prover dynamics [here](/docs/concepts/proving#prover-dynamics) (especially to set your expectations about running a prover).

## Prerequisites

- You have already setup a node (see: [Run a node](/docs/guides/run-a-node))
- Should have at least 8/16 core CPU and 32GB of RAM.

### Grimsvotn L2

- Must have a balance of ETH on Sepolia L1 (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

### Eldfell L3

- Must have a balance of ETH on Grimsvotn L2 (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

## Steps

<Steps>
### Open the .env file in `simple-taiko-node`

For Grimsvotn L2:

```sh
nano .env
```

For Eldfell L3:

```sh
nano .env.l3
```


### Set environment variables to enable prover

<Callout type="warning">
  Do **not** use a private key that is valuable to you. The private key will be
  stored in plain text in the `.env` or `.env.l3` file, and this is not secure.
  There is a real risk of losing your assets. You should **only use a test
  account**.
</Callout>

Set the following environment variables to enable your node as a prover:

For Grimsvotn L2 `.env`:

```sh
ENABLE_PROVER=true # change from false to true
# A L1 account (with balance) private key which will send the TaikoL1.proveBlock transactions.
L1_PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 # your prover's private key
```

For Eldfell L3 `.env.l3`:

```sh
ENABLE_PROVER=true # change from false to true
# A L2 account (with balance) private key which will send the TaikoL1.proveBlock transactions.
L2_PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 # your prover's private key
```

### Verify prover logs

Verify you have some prover logs:

- `ðŸ’° Your block proof was accepted` means you are the first prover and receive the reward.
- `âœ… Block proven` just means a proposed block was successfully proved on TaikoL1 (by anyone).

You can check all commands to see prover logs in the [node runner manual](/docs/manuals/node-runner-manual#view-client-prover-relayer-logs).

L2
```sh
docker compose logs -f l3_taiko_client_prover_relayer |egrep "block proof was|proof submission error|Block proven"
```

L3
```sh
docker compose -f ./docker-compose.l3.yml --env-file .env.l3 logs -f l3_taiko_client_prover_relayer |egrep "block proof was|proof submission error|Block proven"
```

### Stake your TTKOe (Eldfell L3 provers only)

The simple-taiko-node comes with a default value of `PROVE_UNASSIGNED_BLOCKS` set to `true`. This means that your prover will attempt to prove these open blocks. To be assigned blocks by the protocol, you need to stake your TTKOe.

If you are trying to run a prover for Eldfell L3 first keep in mind, the competition for getting into the prover pool will be high. But don't worry! Even if you get slashed, there's nothing wrong with that. TTKOe is a worthless testnet token, and even getting slashed really helps us to test the network.

To stake your TTKOe try using the [staking dashboard](https://staking.l3test.taiko.xyz/) or the base layer contract manually (see [TaikoL1](/docs/reference/contract-addresses)).

To be one of the provers, you must stake more than current prover stakes, and in the list of top 32 stakers [here](https://staking.l3test.taiko.xyz/#/currentProvers).

The stake amount would be calculated by Capacity/Amount per Capacity. If you want to stake 2 TTKOe with 32 capacity, your Amount per Capacity will be calculated as: `2 / 32 = 0.0625`.

If you have already staked some amount, only the difference will be deducted from your balance.

1. Set the amount per capacity. This is the amount you in TTKOe you are staking. The more you stake, the higher your rank will be in prover pool.
2. Set the reward per gas. This is the reward you want to receive in TTKOe. A good value would be close to the current protocol `feePerGas`.
3. Set the capacity you can provide. This is the amount of parallel blocks you can handle within the proof window.

### Changing the Staked TTKOe Amount (Only for Eldfell L3 Provers)

In the event that you have staked TTKOe and made an error in the amount, you can change the staked amount at any time here. However, there are some considerations.

For example, if you've staked 2 TTKOe and want to change the staked amount to 1 TTKOe, the difference of 1 TTKOe will be exited and you will not be able to withdraw it for a week. Be careful when entering the amount.

<Callout type="warning">
  Always manually add eight zeros for the decimal '10^8`.
</Callout>

Enter the amount you wish to change your stake to for `amount` on the `stake()` function. Unlike the Staking Dashboard's Amount per Capacity, the entered amount will be the total staked amount. You can call the stake function on the ProverPool contract [here](https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz/address/0xC9580414A4372BDdBd8e19e01854DC0B2b1390Cf).

Here are the parameters to set for `stake()`:
- `amount`
- `rewardPerGas (uint32)`
- `maxCapacity (uint32)` (minimum: 32)

In the example above, if you enter 1 in the amount and click Write, the amount will change from 2 to 1, and 1 TTKOe will be exited.

### Exit your prover from prover pool (Eldfell L3 provers only)

If you want to stop proving, you can exit your prover from the prover pool. This will stop your prover from being assigned blocks.

There are two actions you can use on the `ProverPool.sol` contract, the proxy contract can be found [here](/docs/reference/contract-addresses#based-contracts-1):

1. Withdraw. This will withdraw your stake for your prover.
2. Exit. This will withdraw your stake and fully exit you from the prover pool (delete from storage).

If want to temporarily leave the pool a withdraw should be enough, if you want to completely leave the pool you should use exit.
