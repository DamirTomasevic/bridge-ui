This guide will help you interact with Swap, which is a fork of Uniswap v2 which Taiko has deployed only for testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- You must have some tokens (at least ETH) on Taiko (Askja testnet). You can [receive some ETH, HORSE, and BLL from the faucets](/docs/guides/receive-tokens) and then [bridge them to Taiko](/docs/guides/use-the-bridge).

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Navigate to Swap
    Navigate to [https://swap.a2.taiko.xyz](https://swap.a2.taiko.xyz).

    ### Swap some tokens
    Swap some tokens. You can receive some testnet tokens [here](/docs/guides/receive-tokens).

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Token list does not show up
If the "Taiko Tokens List" does not show up at "Select a list", you can add [this token list](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/d1onys1us/8f8824daed0882b1094296f824fae53c/raw/15204c4a4927a7f48a78c195323ce0d573d6b7c0/taiko_tokens.json).
