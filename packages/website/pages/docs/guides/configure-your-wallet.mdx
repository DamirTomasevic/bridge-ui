This guide help you connect your wallet to Taiko (Askja testnet). There are two networks to configure your wallet with: **Ethereum (Sepolia testnet)** and **Taiko (Askja testnet)**.

## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed and ready to use. Some examples are MetaMask and Frame. Please use a hot wallet (not a hardware wallet) for this guide, preferably a throwaway wallet.

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Add the Sepolia testnet
    Visit [https://chainid.network/](https://chainid.network/), search for "Sepolia", and click the "Add Chain" button.

    ### Add the Taiko testnet
    Visit [https://chainid.network/](https://chainid.network/), search for "Taiko", and click the "Add Chain" button.

    ### Add HORSE and BLL tokens to your wallet
    Use your wallet (e.g., Metamask) and [import the tokens](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/6375103346077-Add-custom-tokens-to-MetaMask?docs=true) with [this configuration](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/d1onys1us/8f8824daed0882b1094296f824fae53c/raw/15204c4a4927a7f48a78c195323ce0d573d6b7c0/taiko_tokens.json).
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting
### The add chain buttons did not work
Try to manually add the network to your wallet using the [RPC configuration](/docs/reference/rpc-configuration).
