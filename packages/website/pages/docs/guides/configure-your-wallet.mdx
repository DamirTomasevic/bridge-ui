This guide help you connect your wallet to Taiko (Askja testnet). There are two networks to configure your wallet with: **Ethereum (Sepolia testnet)** and **Taiko (Askja testnet)**.

## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed and ready to use. Some examples are MetaMask and Frame. Please use a hot wallet (not a hardware wallet) for this guide, preferably a throwaway wallet.

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Add the Sepolia testnet
    Visit [https://chainid.network/](https://chainid.network/), search for "Sepolia", and click the "Add Chain" button.

    ### Add the Taiko testnet
    Visit [https://chainid.network/](https://chainid.network/), search for "Taiko", and click the "Add Chain" button.
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting
### The add chain buttons did not work
Try to manually add the network to your wallet using the [RPC configuration](/docs/reference/rpc-configuration).
