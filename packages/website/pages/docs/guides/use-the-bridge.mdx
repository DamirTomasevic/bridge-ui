  The BLL token should succeed when **minting** from the faucet, and when
  **sending the bridge message** to Sepolia or Taiko. However, it will fail
  about 50% of the time when **claiming** on Sepolia—this is intentionally done
  so we can test the error handling.

This guide will help you use the bridge to send tokens between Sepolia and Taiko (Askja testnet). You can read more about how bridging works [here](/docs/concepts/bridging/cross-chain-messaging).

> The HORSE token and BLL token are both dummy test tokens that are used for testing the bridge and swap.

## Prerequisites

- A wallet with some testnet ETH on Sepolia and/or Taiko (you can [receive tokens here](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Visit the bridge
    Visit the [bridge](https://bridge.a2.taiko.xyz/) and the UI should be intuitive.

    ### Bridge tokens from Sepolia to Taiko
    Try bridging ETH, HORSE, and/or BLL from Sepolia to Taiko. You can also try manually claiming the transfer yourself by clicking the "Claim" button under the "Transactions" tab.
