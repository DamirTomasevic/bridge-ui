    <Callout type="info">
    TTKO has been distributed to all proposers and provers from the alpha-1 and alpha-2 testnets. Check your address balance on Sepolia. Currently, the only other way to receive TTKO is by successfully generating proofs on alpha-3 testnet, for which the protocol rewards you in TTKO.
