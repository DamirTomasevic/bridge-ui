# Deploy a contract

## Overview

This guide will help you deploy a smart contract to Taiko using Foundry or Hardhat.

## Prerequisites

- You have [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#quick-start) installed.
- You have testnet ETH on Taiko (to pay the transaction fee for deploying the contract).
   - You can [request Sepolia ETH](/docs/guides/receive-tokens#receive-sepolia-eth) from the faucet and then [use the bridge](/docs/guides/use-the-bridge) to send the testnet ETH to Taiko.
- You have the private key to the account with testnet ETH on Taiko.

### Additional Remix prerequisites
- You have [configured your wallet](/docs/guides/configure-your-wallet) to connect to Taiko.

   <Steps>
   ### Create a project with Foundry
   ```sh
   forge init hello_foundry && cd hello_foundry
   ```

   ### Deploy your contract
   Deploy the contract located at `src/Counter.sol`. Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` below with your private key which has some testnet ETH on Taiko.
   <Callout type="warning">
   Use a throwaway wallet to be safe. Don't reveal the private key of a wallet with significant value!
   </Callout>

   ```sh
   forge create --rpc-url https://rpc.test.taiko.xyz --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY src/Counter.sol:Counter
   ```

   ### View your contract
   Paste the address from the output into the [Taiko block explorer](https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz) and verify that the contract was deployed.

      ### Create a project with Hardhat
      ```sh
      npx hardhat
      ```

      ### Add Taiko to your Hardhat config
      <Callout type="warning">
      For the `accounts` array, you will need to enter the private key of the account you are deploying the contract with. It is **not recommended** to hardcode the private key like this (an environment variable would be better, but is still risky).

      Use a throwaway wallet to be safe. Don't reveal the private key of a wallet with significant value!

      ```ts {6-13} filename=hardhat.config.ts
      import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
      import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";

      const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
         solidity: "0.8.18",
         networks: {
            taiko: {
               url: "https://rpc.test.taiko.xyz",
               accounts: [
                  "0xf214f2b2cd398c806f84e317254e0f0b801d0643303237d97a22a48e01628897",
               ],
            },
         },
      };

      export default config;
      ```

      ### Deploy your contract on Taiko
      ```sh
      npx hardhat run --network taiko scripts/deploy.ts
      ```

      ### View your contract
      Paste the address from the output into the [Taiko block explorer](https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz) and verify that the contract was deployed.
