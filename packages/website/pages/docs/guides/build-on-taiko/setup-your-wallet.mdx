# Setup your wallet

This guide helps you connect your wallet to Taiko's networks.

## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed and available to your browser.

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Visit RPC configuration
    Visit the [RPC configuration page](/docs/reference/rpc-configuration) and click the buttons to add the networks. Or, add them manually in your wallet with the provided configuration.

    ### Add tokens to your wallet
    Use your wallet (e.g., Metamask) to [import the tokens](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/6375103346077-Add-custom-tokens-to-MetaMask?docs=true). You can find all deployed tokens contract addresses [here](/docs/reference/contract-addresses).

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### The add chain buttons did not work

Try to manually add the network to your wallet using the [RPC configuration](/docs/reference/rpc-configuration), or by using [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org) (make sure to check the box for "Include testnets").
