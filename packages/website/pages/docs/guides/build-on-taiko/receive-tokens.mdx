# Receive tokens

This guide will help you receive testnet tokens. You can see all the deployed tokens [here](/docs/reference/contract-addresses). Keep in mind HORSE and BLL faucets only distribute to Grimsvotn L2. To get HORSE and BLL on Eldfell L3, you will need to [use the bridge](/docs/guides/build-on-taiko/bridge-tokens).

## Prerequisites

- You have an Ethereum wallet address to accept the testnet tokens.

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Receive Sepolia ETH
    Visit one of the faucets to receive ETH on Sepolia:
      - [sepolia-faucet.pk910.de](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de)
      - [faucet-sepolia.rockx.com](https://faucet-sepolia.rockx.com)
      - [sepoliafaucet.com](https://sepoliafaucet.com)
      - [infura.io/faucet/sepolia](https://infura.io/faucet/sepolia)
      - [faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia)
      - [coinbase.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia-faucet](https://coinbase.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia-faucet)
      - [faucet.chainstack.com/sepolia-faucet](https://faucet.chainstack.com/sepolia-faucet)

    ### Receive HORSE
    Navigate to the [Sepolia L1 â†” Grimsvotn L2 bridge](https://bridge.test.taiko.xyz), select HORSE from the dropdown, and click "Faucet".

    ### Receive BLL
    Repeat the previous step for receiving HORSE, except select "BLL" from the dropdown.

    ### Receive TTKO
    <Callout type="info">
    TTKO has been distributed to all proposers and provers from the alpha-1 and alpha-2 testnets and you can see those transactions [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x19B4F9C381C7927FE33D853e48b560141A380C44). You can see the script used [here](https://github.com/taikoxyz/operations).
    </Callout>


    It's possible more will be distributed, especially considering those that did not run a proposer/prover in alpha1/alpha2, and those who are new to the Taiko community.
    Otherwise, you can obtain TTKO by successfully [proving blocks](/docs/guides/enable-a-prover) (the protocol rewards you in TTKO) or from [Swap](https://swap.test.taiko.xyz).

    ### Receive TTKOe
    TTKOe has been distributed to all proposers and provers from the alpha-1 and alpha-2 testnets and you can see those transactions [here](https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz/address/0x7532Cd98ED13c0C164dBC7a92D872955c8C99bD3). You can see the script used [here](https://github.com/taikoxyz/operations).

    Otherwise, you can obtain TTKOe by successfully [proving blocks](/docs/guides/enable-a-prover) (the protocol rewards you in TTKOe) or from [Swap](https://swap.l3test.taiko.xyz).
