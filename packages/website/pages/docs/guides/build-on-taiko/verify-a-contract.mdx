   <Steps>
        <strong>
            1. Add Etherscan config to Hardhat config
        </strong>
        <Callout type="info">
            Even though the config is called `etherscan`, it is used for all explorers that support the Etherscan API (including Blockscout). The API key is set to a dummy value `42069` because it is not used for Blockscout verification.
        </Callout>

        ```ts {14-28} filename=hardhat.config.ts
        import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
        import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";

        const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
            solidity: "0.8.18",
            networks: {
                taiko: {
                    url: "https://rpc.test.taiko.xyz",
                    accounts: [
                        "0xf214f2b2cd398c806f84e317254e0f0b801d0643303237d97a22a48e01628897",
                    ],
                },
            },
            etherscan: {
                apiKey: {
                    taiko: "42069",
                },
                customChains: [
                    {
                        network: "taiko",
                        chainId: 167005,
                        urls: {
                            apiURL: "https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz/api",
                            browserURL: "https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz",
                        },
                    },
                ],
            },
        };

        export default config;
        ```

        <strong>
            2. Run the verify task
        </strong>
        Run the verify task, but replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `"Constructor argument 1"` with the address of your deployed contract and the constructor arguments you used when deploying the contract.

        ```sh
        npx hardhat verify --network taiko DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor argument 1"
        ```
        <strong>
            3. View your verified contract on Blockscout
        </strong>
        Check the [Taiko block explorer](https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz) link from the output to see your contract was verified.
    </Steps>

    Follow Blockscout's [official guide](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-users/verifying-a-smart-contract) to verify your contract on Taiko's blockscout explorers.

    <Callout type="warning">
        Foundry's `verify-contract` command is currently broken with Blockscout (see why [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4909)). Please check the Hardhat or Blockscout steps to verify your contract.
