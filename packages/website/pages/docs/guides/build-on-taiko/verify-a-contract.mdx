# Verify a contract

This guide will help get your contract verified on a Taiko testnet!

## Prerequisites

- You have a contract deployed on a Taiko testnet and the source code available.

## Steps

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to set the RPC to the network you are trying to deploy to. The ones
  here just use Grimsvotn L2 as an example. You can see all the RPC urls under
  [RPC configuration](/docs/reference/rpc-configuration).
</Callout>

    **1. Add Etherscan config to Hardhat config**

    <Callout type="info">
        Even though the config is called `etherscan`, it is used for all explorers that support the Etherscan API (including Blockscout). The API key is set to a dummy value `42069` because it is not used for Blockscout verification.
    </Callout>

    ```ts {14-28} filename=hardhat.config.ts
    import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
    import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";

    const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
        solidity: "0.8.18",
        networks: {
            taiko: {
                url: "https://rpc.test.taiko.xyz",
                accounts: [
                    "0xf214f2b2cd398c806f84e317254e0f0b801d0643303237d97a22a48e01628897",
                ],
            },
        },
        etherscan: {
            apiKey: {
                taiko: "42069",
            },
            customChains: [
                {
                    network: "taiko",
                    chainId: 167005,
                    urls: {
                        apiURL: "https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz/api",
                        browserURL: "https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz",
                    },
                },
            ],
        },
    };

    export default config;
    ```

    **2. Run the verify task**

    Run the verify task, but replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `"Constructor argument 1"` with the address of your deployed contract and the constructor arguments you used when deploying the contract.

    ```sh
    npx hardhat verify --network taiko DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor argument 1"
    ```

    **3. View your verified contract on Blockscout**

    Check the [Taiko block explorer](https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz) link from the output to see your contract was verified.

    Follow Blockscout's [official guide](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-users/verifying-a-smart-contract) to verify your contract on Taiko's blockscout explorers.

    <Callout type="warning">
        Foundry's `verify-contract` command is currently broken with Blockscout (see why [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4909)). Please check the Hardhat or Blockscout steps to verify your contract.
