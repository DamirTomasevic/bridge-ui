# Enable a proposer

This guide will help you enable your Taiko node as a proposer.

## Prerequisites

- You have already setup a node (see: [Run a node](/docs/guides/run-a-taiko-node)).
- Must have a balance of ETH on Sepolia L1 (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).
- Access to either a local prover (see: [Enable a prover](/docs/guides/enable-a-prover)) or an outsourced prover from the [prover market](/docs/reference/prover-market-page). Read more about the proof design [here](/docs/concepts/proving).

## Steps

<Steps>

### Open .env file in `simple-taiko-node`

```sh
nano .env
```

### Set environment variables to enable a proposer

<Callout type="error">
  Do **not** use a private key that is valuable to you. The private key will be
  stored in plain text in the `.env` file, and this is not secure. There is a
  real risk of losing your assets. You should **only use a test account**.

  To generate an isolated burner wallet locally:

  <Tabs items={["foundry", "ethers.js"]} defaultIndex="0">
    <Tab>
        ```shell
        cast wallet new | tee /dev/tty | 
        grep 'Private key:' | awk '{print "export PRIVATE_KEY="$3}' >> .env && source .env
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```js
      var ethers = require('ethers');  
      var crypto = require('crypto');

      var id = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
      var privateKey = "0x"+id;
      console.log("SAVE BUT DO NOT SHARE THIS:", privateKey);

      var wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey);
      console.log("Address: " + wallet.address);
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs> 
</Callout>

Set the following environment variables to enable your node as a proposer:

<Callout type="error">
  For `L1_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY` 
  make sure your private key is in hexadecimal format and with the `0x` prefix removed!
  Otherwise you will get this error in your proposer status logs:
  ```
  simple-taiko-node-taiko_client_proposer-1  | invalid L1 proposer private key: invalid length, need 256 bits
  ```
</Callout>

- Set `ENABLE_PROPOSER` to `true`
- Set `L1_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY` to the private key of your L1 account (with balance) who will send TaikoL1.proposeBlock transactions
- Set `L2_SUGGESTED_FEE_RECIPIENT` to the address of your L2 account who will be the tx fee beneficiary of the L2 blocks that you proposed

### Set a prover market prover (needed if not running a prover locally)

Doing this is optional if you are already running a local prover. See [enable a prover](/docs/guides/enable-a-prover) for more information on how to set that up. By default the proposer will select your local prover to provide bonds for the proposed blocks.

If you are not running a local prover, then you can specify a prover from the [prover market](/docs/reference/prover-market-page) by overriding the default value for:

- `PROVER_ENDPOINTS`

### Check proposer status logs

To see if your proposer is running correctly or has errors run:

```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_proposer
```

### See proposed blocks

When you run:

```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_proposer | egrep "Propose transactions succeeded"
```

if your proposer successfully proposed a block, your logs should show: `üìù Propose transactions succeeded`.

You can check all commands to see proposer logs in the [node runner manual](/docs/manuals/node-runner-manual#view-client-proposer-logs).

</Steps>

## Tokenomics

The proposer orders (sequences) transactions in a block. Transaction fees to be included into a block are paid in ETH.
To extract as much MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) as possible paid in ETH, each proposer will try to search the mempool to:
```
-‚úÖ fit as many valid transctions into a block as possible
-üí∞ include transactions with the highest fees
``` 
The proposer must then deliver their proposed blocks to a prover.
