## What is Taiko?

Taiko is a fully decentralized, Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup (a [Type 1 ZK-EVM](https://mirror.xyz/labs.taiko.eth/w7NSKDeKfJoEy0p89I9feixKfdK-20JgWF9HZzxfeBo)). Taiko's full decentralization and Ethereum-equivalence are two big differentiators when compared to other ZK-EVMs.

Taiko is working on the full Ethereum [ZK-EVM circuits](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits) as part of a community effort led by the EF's PSE team.
