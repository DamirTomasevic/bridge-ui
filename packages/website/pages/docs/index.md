# Introduction

Taiko is a fully decentralized, Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup. This is also referred to as a [Type 1 ZK-EVM](https://mirror.xyz/labs.taiko.eth/w7NSKDeKfJoEy0p89I9feixKfdK-20JgWF9HZzxfeBo).

## The Alpha-1 (Sn√¶fellsj√∂kull) Testnet

There are two networks involved in the alpha-1 testnet:

- **Taiko A1** is the Alpha-1 testnet release of Taiko: A fully decentralized, Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup.
- **Ethereum A1** is Taiko's privately deployed Ethereum network, which serves as the L1 for Taiko's Alpha-1 testnet.

The testnet consists of L1 / L2 nodes with all of the Taiko protocol contracts deployed. The mining interval of the L1 node is set to 12 seconds. There is also a cron job service that proposes empty blocks every two minutes.

### Use the testnet

In this testnet, you can:

- üåâ Bridge tokens between Ethereum A1 and Taiko A1.
- ü§ù Send transactions (e.g., deploy a dapp, interact with a contract).
- üåê Run a node‚Äîthis makes **you** a part of Taiko!

Check out the guides in the left sidebar to use the testnet!
