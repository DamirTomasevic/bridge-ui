# Proposing Taiko blocks

On Taiko, the next L2 state is known immediately and deterministically at the time a block is proposed to the TaikoL1 contract. After a block is proposed, a series of checks are done to compute this post-L2 state:

1. Block is proposed by any proposer (permissionlessly).
2. Block level properties' validity is checked by the TaikoL1 contract with the proposed block intrinsic validity function.
3. Proposed block is downloaded by a Taiko node, and the transaction list is parsed over and checked for validity transaction list intrinsic validity function.
   - IF every transaction in the list is valid, an ordered subset of the list is created by skipping over transactions which have an invalid nonce or the sender has too little Ether balance to pay for the transaction. This ordered subset is used along with the [anchor transaction](./proposing#anchor-transaction) to create a Taiko L2 block.
   - IF any transaction in the list is invalid, an empty block (with only the anchor tx) is created on L2.

## Building the blocks

The Ethereum yellow paper has well-defined rules to compute the state transition. We use these same rules to take a proposed block, and compute the post-block state on Taiko. The high level overview of creating L2 blocks as follows:

1. The system starts by creating a new L2 block with an anchor transaction. This anchor transaction is always the first transaction in the block even if the block is empty. (More about anchor transactions in the next section.)

2. There are validity checks performed at the node (or sometimes protocol) level as well:

   2.1 Asserts that the length of the transaction list does not exceed a predefined maximum (MAX_TX_LIST_BYTES), ensuring that the list is within the limits.

   2.2 The transaction list is (RLP) decoded into a list of transactions (txList). If the bytes are not decodable it will result in an empty block.

   2.3 The amount of gas required to include transactions is available. (If a transaction cannot fit into a block, it is simply excluded from it, but the block is still valid with other transactions.)

   2.4 The transaction signature is valid.

   2.5 The transaction nonce is valid.

   2.6 The sender account has no contract code deployed (EIP-3607).

   2.7 The transaction's gas limit is no smaller than the intrinsic gas.

   2.8. The sender has enough balance to cover the transaction (gasLimit \* gasPrice + tx.value).

## Anchor transaction

The anchor transaction is a way for the protocol to make use of the programmability of the EVM (which we already need to be able to proof) to enforce certain protocol behavior. We can add additional tasks to anchor transactions to enrich Taiko’s functionalities by writing standard smart contract code (instead of requiring more complicated changes to Taiko’s ZK-EVM and node subsystems).

The anchor transaction is required to be the first transaction in a Taiko block (which is important to make the block deterministic). The anchor transaction is currently used as follows:

1. Persisting `l1Height`, `l1Hash` and `l1SignalRoot` to the storage trie. These values can be used by bridges to validate cross-chain messages.
2. Ensuring that the previous 256 block hashes that are exposed to the EVM are correct.
3. Calculating the EIP-1559 `basefee` which will be used on L2.

## How does the proposer earn Ether

When the block is proposed, the TaikoL1 contract will set some L2 block metadata such as `meta.coinbase`, which is the sender of the proposeBlock() tx. When the L2 client builds the L2 block, it will set the `block.coinbase` to this `meta.coinbase` specified for the block on L1. The validity proof (ZKP) for this block must check that the `block.coinbase` is indeed the `meta.coinbase` recorded on L1.

When the ZKP instance is returned from the `TaikoL1` contract with `calcInstance()`, the `evidence.metaHash` for the proposed block is included. This is how the ZKP verifier can check that the L2's `block.coinbase` (and other block-level variables as well) are correctly set to what is specified in the metadata on L1.

## How does the proposer earn TKO

The first proposeBlock tx in the enclosing L1 block will earn the TKO reward. The proposer will receive either the maximum reward (specified in the L1 config), or the reward per second (also specified in the L1 config as well) times the block time, whichever is smaller.

> Note: This is a temporary solution which may change soon, as we see an issue that can arise where the proposer will submit empty blocks to earn the reward. Check the comments in `LibProposing.sol:proposeBlock` for the latest design.
