# Proving Taiko blocks

The purpose of proving blocks is to give certainty to bridges about the execution that happened in the rollup. To rely on some state that happened inside of the rollup, a bridge will want a proof that everything was done correctly. On Taiko you can run a node as a prover and prove blocks, permissionlessly. This means that you can examine the proposed blocks on the TaikoL1 contract, and generate proofs for them. Currently, any prover can create proofs for proposed blocks. This means that the number of "state transitions" has no upper bound, because we don't know what is the correct state transition yet. Only first prover with a valid proof of the correct state transition (state transition) will receive the reward of TTKO.

## Verified blocks and parallel proving

There are three states that a block can be in on Taiko:

- Proposed
- Proved
- Verified

We already know what a proposed block is (must pass at least the block-level intrinsic validity tests to be accepted by the TaikoL1 contract). Next, a proposed block can be valid or invalid, depending on whether it passes the transaction list intrinsic validity test. A block is invalid if it fails the transaction list intrinsic validity test, and this block is not created on Taiko.

Now, a block can be proved, but also further "verified". What's the difference? A block is proved if it has a valid proof which proves a state transition from one state (parent block) to another (current block). However, blocks are proven in parallel by the decentralized provers. So while a block can prove a parent block transitions to the current block, we don't know if the parent block itself has been proven. As you can see, for a block to be "verified", it needs to prove the valid state transition to the current block, but the parent also needs to be verified. We assume that the genesis block (which has no parent), is verified. So all the children blocks from genesis to the current block need to have proofs of their state transition for the current block to be "verified".

For the visual learners here is a visualization of the three stages (proposed -> proved -> verified)

## Types of provers

### Community prover

Currently, you only need a single proof from any prover to verify a block.

### Oracle prover

The oracle prover is a prover from a unique address (our own address) that is able to override the community prover. This is a safety mechanism we have in place while the ZK-EVM is still in development and in case an invalid block was marked as verified from a community proof.

### Oracle prover

A oracle prover generates a fake proof to mark a block as verified. We only require a real proof to be generated every N blocks. Otherwise, we accept a fake, oracle proof, and mark the block as verified. This is a temporary testnet feature to reduce the cost for community provers.

### The proof cooldown period

We have a proof cooldown period which is an interval of time we set after fully verifying a block. The reason we do that is to allow for a fault proof to come in, once we have a multi-prover system set in place.

## Prover dynamics

Keep in mind that running a prover on mainnet will be a very competitive space, and those who generate proofs will have very powerful machines. It's unlikely anyone will be able to be a "casual prover".

{/* TODO: we should not mention testnet details inside concept documentation (this is like a whitepaper), we can find another abstraction for it */}

### Grimsvotn L2 (alpha-3)

In the alpha-3 protocol, the protocol rewards the most efficient prover. The prover that can submit a valid proof the fastest, will win the reward. This trades off decentralization for efficiency, because in a mainnet scenario it's likely only a single prover will prevail, which is a bit risky for liveness.

#### How the proof reward is determined

A proof reward in TTKO is rewarded for successfully proving a block. This reward is dependent on the `proofTimeTarget`. You can see the current proof reward by calling `getProofReward` on the TaikoL1 contract.

So that we don't grow a long list of unverified blocks for too long, we want to target proofs coming in at a certain rate. So we set a target proof time. If it has taken a long time since the last verified block, the proof reward increases to incentivize provers to generate a proof.

Conversely, if everyone is submitting proofs quickly, then the proof reward decreases towards zero. This means that as a prover, you should query `getProofReward` on the TaikoL1 contract to determine if it is profitable to generate a proof. If you submit proofs as quickly as possible, then the proof reward will trend towards zero.

#### Default in simple-taiko-node

The [simple-taiko-node](https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node) will come pre-configured to not submit proofs as quickly as possible, by querying `getProofReward`. This hopefully means that most nodes in the network are acting in the group interest, by responsibly not submitting the proof as quickly as possible. However, because the first prover will win the reward, and because the project is open source, anybody can modify the [taiko-client](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-client) and act rationally to submit a proof slightly earlier than the default set in `simple-taiko-node`. As you can see, it causes somewhat of a prisoner's dilemma.

#### Proof skip

We have a `realProofSkipSize` set [here](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/main/packages/protocol/contracts/L1/TaikoConfig.sol#LL40C13-L40C30) so that a real proof is only needed every N blocks for the testnet.

#### Your role as a prover

We are describing this dynamic so you can be informed when you run a prover. It's very possible that without the correct strategy, you will not be profitable as a prover. You are naturally competing in an open space where others could have more efficient hardware and generate a proof in a short amount of time that you cannot compete against.

### Eldfell L3 (alpha-4)

In the alpha-4 protocol we have developed a staking based proving system. There exists a pool of (currently 32) top provers. Entering this pool depends on several factors:

- The capacity a prover can handle
- The amount of TTKOe staked
- The expected reward per gas
- The current fee per gas

Essentially, this design is slightly less efficient but more decentralized (with better liveness).

You can read more about the staking system [here](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/alpha-4/packages/protocol/docs/tokenomics_staking.md).
