# Taiko integration guide

Taiko is an Ethereum-equivalent network, meaning integrating with Taiko should be as simple as adding our RPC.

## RPC configuration

You can view the RPC configuration [here](/docs/reference/rpc-configuration).

## Taiko brand assets

When using the Taiko logo, please use one of the branding icons/logos [here](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/tree/main/packages/branding).

## Add/update your project to our Ecosystem page

Click **Add your project** on our Ecosystem page [here](/ecosystem).

This will take you to a form where you can add/update details about your project. We will then handle the request and get it added to our page.

## Additional support

If you have any questions or are in need of any support to integrate Taiko, please reach out. We understand there may be more complex scenarios or questions in your integration, so we are here to help.

You can message us / the community on Discord, and also contact a DevRel Engineer directly with the `@devrel` tag.
