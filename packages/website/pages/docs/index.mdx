## Welcome to Taiko 🥁

Taiko is a decentralized, Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup ([Type 1 ZK-EVM](https://mirror.xyz/labs.taiko.eth/w7NSKDeKfJoEy0p89I9feixKfdK-20JgWF9HZzxfeBo)). We're working on the full Ethereum [ZK-EVM circuits](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits) as part of a community effort led by the Ethereum Foundation's Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team but

> "34.469 lines of code are not going to be bug-free for a long long time" - Vitalik Buterin about the ZK-EVM circuit code.

If we can't make them bug-free then what we could do about it ? There are different practical, short and mid-term alternatives (Proof-of-governance based override, self-cancellation, etc.) to secure the network and Taiko decided to use a multi-prover system going forward.

Check out the [Taiko roadmap](/images/roadmaps/taiko-roadmap.png) to see where we're going!
