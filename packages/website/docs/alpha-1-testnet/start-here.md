# 👋 Start here

Welcome to Taiko's Alpha-1 testnet, **Snæfellsjökull**. There are two networks involved in the testnet:

- **Taiko A1** is the Alpha-1 testnet release of Taiko: A fully decentralized, Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup.
- **Ethereum A1** is Taiko's privately deployed Ethereum network, which serves as the L1 for Taiko's Alpha-1 testnet.

## Use the testnet

In this testnet, you can:

- 🌉 Bridge tokens between Ethereum A1 and Taiko A1.
- 🤝 Send transactions (e.g., deploy contracts).
- 🌐 Run a node—this makes **you** a part of Taiko!
- 📝 Submit feedback and be forever loved.
- 🥇 Earn a POAP by using your wallet to complete any 2 of the 3 following actions by ~~January 31st 23:59 UTC~~ January 5th 23:59 UTC:
  - Use the bridge.
  - Interact with a contract (e.g., interact with a dapp, deploy a contract).
  - Transfer between accounts.
