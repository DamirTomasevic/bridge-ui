# 🌐 Run a node

This is arguably the most important part of the testnet! Taiko is fully decentralized and relies on the community to run nodes.

Follow the guide at [simple-taiko-node/README.md](https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node/blob/main/README.md) to get started.

:::note
You will only be able to run a node regularly or as a proposer. In this testnet we are not running any provers.
