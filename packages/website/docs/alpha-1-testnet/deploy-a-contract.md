# ðŸš€ Deploy a contract

These steps will show you how to deploy a smart contract to Taiko A1 using Foundry. You can find the latest Foundry docs at the Foundry Book: https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/first-steps. This guide uses snippets / examples from there.

## Prerequisites

- Have the private key to an account that has some ETH on Taiko A1. This is to pay the small transaction fee for deploying the contract.

## Steps

1. [Install Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
2. Create a project with Foundry, and `cd` into it:
   ```sh
   forge init hello_foundry && cd hello_foundry
   ```
3. Deploy the contract from your project, located at `src/Counter.sol`. Replace `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` with your private key, mentioned in the previous prerequisites section.
   ```sh
   forge create --legacy --rpc-url https://l2rpc.a1.taiko.xyz --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> src/Counter.sol:Counter
   ```
   Note: Remove "<" and ">" from <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>

We are using the `--legacy` flag because EIP-1559 is currently disabled on Taiko. We have plans to re-enable it in the future.

You can use the block explorer to verify that the contract was deployed: https://l2explorer.a1.taiko.xyz/
