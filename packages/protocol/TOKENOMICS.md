## TAIKO Tokenomics

This document outlines the current tokenomics.

-   $D_i$: The _i_-th block's proving delay.
-   $A_i$: The average block proving delay after the _i_-th block.

We have:
$$A_i = {63 A_{i-1} + D_i \over 64}$$

-   $B$: a fix amount of gas per block.
-   $L_i$: The block gas limit for the _i_-th block.

-   $F_i$: The proposer fee for the _i_-th block.
-   $\hat{F_i}$: The discouted proposer fee for the _i_-th block, $\hat{F_i} = 0.95F_i$
-   $g_i$: The gas price after the _i_-th block is finalized.

We have (1559-style):

$$ g*i = {{g*{i-1} (31 R*{i-1} + F*{i-1})} \over {32 R\_{i-1}}} $$

-   $\hat{g_i}$: It is $g_i$ adjusted based on the number of pending blocks, the more pending blocks, the bigger $\hat{g_i}$ will be, compared with $g_i$.

We have:
$$F_i = \hat{g_{i-1}} (B+L_i) $$

-   $R_i$: The prover fee for the _i_-th block.

-   $R_i(t)$: The prover fee for the _i_-th block if the block is proven with a delay of $t$.

    -   if $t <= A_{i-1}$ then $R_i(t)=\hat{F_i}$
    -   else $R*i(t)= max( 100 \* \hat{F_i}, ({1 \over 2} + {t \over A*{i-1}})\hat{F_i} ) $

Currently we allow up to 5 proofs per block. If the first proof was submitted with delay $D^1$, all the other _uncle proofs_ must be submitted within a time window of $D^1 \over 2$.

Each uncle proof will earn a return of $R \over 10$, all the rest goes to the first prover. This means the first prover will get 60%-100% of the prover fee.
