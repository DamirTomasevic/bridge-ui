// @KorbinianK , @2manslkh
// As written also in the tests the workflow shall be the following (checklist):
// 1. Is Vault - which will store the tokens - deployed ?
// 2. Is (bridged) TKO token existing ?
// 3. Is ERC20Airdrop contract is 'approved operator' on the TKO token ?
// 4. Proof (merkle root) and minting window related variables (start, end) set ?
// If YES the answer to all above, we can go live with airdrop, which is like:
// 1. User go to website. -> For sake of simplicity he is eligible
// 2. User wants to mint, but first site established the delegateHash (user sets a delegatee) which
// the user signs
// 3. Backend retrieves the proof and together with signature in the input params, user fires away
// the claimAndDelegate() transaction.
