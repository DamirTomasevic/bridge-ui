/// @notice As "single" owner is not desirable for protocols we need to

/// does not help too much if the protocol wants to give some time for
/// the users to exit before an upgrade is effective. So implementing a
/// delay (L2Beat prefers 7 days) is essential.
/// So the usual approach is the following:
/// 1. Transfer ownership to TimeLockController contract which enforces the
/// delay
/// 2. The ownership of the TimeLockController contract shall be a multisig/DAO

/// Invokaction example:
/// forge script TransferOwnership --sig "run(address,address)"  <address>
/// <address>
