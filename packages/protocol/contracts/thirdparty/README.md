# ABOUT THIRDPARTY CODE

- /automata-attestation: original code (main branch) forked from https://github.com/automata-network/automata-dcap-v3-attestation and applied some gas optimizations here: https://github.com/smtmfft/automata-dcap-v3-attestation/tree/optimize-gas, which then got merged into taiko-mono.

- /optimism: code copied from https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-batcher%2Fv1.4.3 as-is with only solidity pragma changed.
