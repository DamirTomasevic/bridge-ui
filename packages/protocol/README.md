# Taiko protocol

This package contains rollup contracts on both L1 and L2, along with other assisting code. Taiko L2's chain ID is [167](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains/pull/1611).

## Deploy

Deploy TaikoL1 on hardhat network:

```sh
pnpm deploy:hardhat
```

## Test

Run test cases on hardhat network:

```sh
pnpm test
```

Run test cases that require a running go-ethereum node:

```sh
pnpm test:integration
```

## Generate L2 genesis JSON's `alloc` field

Start by creating a `config.json`, for example:

```json
{
  // Owner address of the pre-deployed L2 contracts.
  "contractOwner": "0xDf08F82De32B8d460adbE8D72043E3a7e25A3B39",
  // Chain ID of the Taiko L2 network.
  "chainId": 167,
  // Account address and pre-mint ETH amount as key-value pairs.
  "seedAccounts": [
    { "0xDf08F82De32B8d460adbE8D72043E3a7e25A3B39": 1024 },
    { "0x79fcdef22feed20eddacbb2587640e45491b757f": 1024 }
  ],
  // L2 EIP-1559 baseFee calculation related fields.
  "param1559": {
    "yscale": "358298803609133338137582400989",
    "xscale": "1488514844",
    "gasIssuedPerSecond": "12500000",
    "gasExcess": "45450000000"
  },
  // Option to pre-deploy an ERC-20 token.
  "predeployERC20": true
}
```

Next, run the generation script:

```sh
pnpm compile && pnpm generate:genesis config.json
```

The script will output two JSON files under `./deployments`:

- `l2_genesis_alloc.json`: the `alloc` field which will be used in L2 genesis JSON file
- `l2_genesis_storage_layout.json`: the storage layout of those pre-deployed contracts

## Using Foundry

This project also integrates with Foundry for building and testing contracts.

- To compile using foundry: `forge build` or `pnpm compile`
- To run foundry tests: `forge test --gas-report -vvv` or `pnpm test:foundry`

Note that compiling with foundry uses dependencies inside the `lib` dir (instead of `node_modules`).
