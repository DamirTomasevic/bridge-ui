\section{The Taiko Blockchain}


The Taiko blockchain is, as you'd expect, made up of blocks. A block is a collection of transactions that are executed sequentially with some shared property values as described in Section \ref{metadata}. New blocks can be appended to the chain to update its state, which can be calculated by anyone by following the protocol rules for the execution of the transactions.
