## How can you determine when a Taiko block is `Safe` or `Finalized`?

The `Safe` block state on Taiko is analogous to a `Safe` block state on Ethereum.
Every Taiko L2 block has a corresponding Ethereum L1 block as it's origin that can be queried through a [`taiko-geth API`](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth/blob/caf87509fe0f53fc937a3f5cc26325a380a1744e/eth/taiko_api_backend.go#L50).
When that Ethereum L1 block can be considered `Safe`, the corresponding Taiko L2 block can be considered to have reached the same block state.

The `Finalized` block state is referred to as the [`Verified` block state](/core-concepts/multi-proofs#verified-blocks-and-parallel-proving) on Taiko.
A Taiko block is `Finalized`/`Verified` when every state transition from genesis to the current block has valid proofs.

## Example Query and Response:

<Code code='
    {
    "method": "taiko_L1OriginByID", 
    "id":1, 
    "jsonrpc":"2.0", 
    "params":[ "0x19a3c" ]
    }' lang="json" title="query.json" />
<Code code='
    "result": 
        { 
        "blockID": "0x19a3c", 
        "l2BlockHash": "0x0905c85f9a288ebe94eb85743a65c8cf6266097b8b826cdca4f4018e6267c26a", 
        "l1BlockHeight": "0x16ef0f", 
        "l1BlockHash": "0x419f0c5b2cc90078c7040c3b90d174895ce83d76ebfdd75ad2dd5521036d0938"
        }' lang="json" title="response.json" />

The above Taiko block with blockID `0x19a3c` would thus be considered `Safe` if the L1 block with the blockHash `0x419f..` reaches a `Safe` state.

The Taiko block with blockID `019a3c` would be `Finalized`/`Verified` if every state transition from genesis to the current block has a valid proof.
