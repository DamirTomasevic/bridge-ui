description: This guide will you help you enable your Taiko node as a proposer.
---

import { Aside, Card, CardGrid, Steps} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Prerequisites

- You are already running a Taiko node [with Docker](/guides/node-operators/run-a-taiko-node-with-docker) or [from source](/guides/node-operators/build-a-taiko-node-from-source).
- You are able to receive prover bonds from your own prover or from [a community marketplace](https://dojonode.xyz/tatami).

{/*## Using `stn`

1. Install [stn](https://github.com/d1onys1us/stn) if you haven't already.
2. Execute `stn config proposer` in your terminal and walk through the steps.*/}

## Using simple-taiko-node

<Aside>
These are the bare minimum required settings along with a functional Taiko node to run a proposer, feel free to customize the rest of the variables in the `.env` file as you see fit!
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. First, you will need to have a prover from <a href="https://dojonode.xyz/tatami" target="_blank">the community marketplace</a> or [run your own SGX prover](/guides/node-operators/enable-a-prover).

2. You MUST set `PROVER_ENDPOINTS` in simple-taiko-node `.env` file to the your SGX prover's endpoint or one from the marketplace. If you do not set it and leave it default while not running a prover, **your proposer will not work**.

3. Next, set the `L1_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY` to an L1 account's private key which will send the Propose Block transactions.

4. Then, set the `L2_SUGGESTED_FEE_RECIPIENT` to an L2 account's public key that will receive the fee.

5. Finally set `ENABLE_PROPOSER` to `true` in simple-taiko-node `.env`.

6. Set `COMPOSE_PROFILES=proposer` or add proposer to the list.

7. Now that the proposer is configured properly, you can run it with `docker compose up -d`!

    <Aside type="danger">
      We strongly recommend you [deploy a `ProverSet` contract](/guides/node-operators/deploy-a-proverset) to run your proposer. If you don't, you will run into nonce issues running your proposer and prover from the same EOA.
      
      If you are working with a third party prover, you will have to follow the guide with them to negotiate allowance and deposit of TAIKO/TTKOh.
