### `Caught SIGILL in blst_cgo_init`

If you get this error message, chances are you're using an older CPU that blst has trouble compiling on due to instruction differences.

In this case, please set your env as follows and try again.

```bash
CGO_CFLAGS="-O -D__BLST_PORTABLE__" 
CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW="-O -D__BLST_PORTABLE__"
```

### Failed to decode tx list: beacon client not found

This may mean that you may be missing the `--l1.beacon` flag or have filled it in incorrectly.

Please use an L1 Node that has a blob server configured!
