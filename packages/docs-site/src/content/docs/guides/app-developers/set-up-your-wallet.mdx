This guide will help you set up your wallet to start using Taiko.

## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed (e.g., [Rabby](https://rabby.io/), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)).

## Add chains to your wallet

<Aside>
We **recommend you choose a Taiko Labs maintained RPC** which ends in `.taiko.xyz` (e.g., `https://rpc.mainnet.taiko.xyz`).
</Aside>

Click **Connect Wallet** at the links below:

- Taiko mainnet: https://chainlist.org/chain/167000
- Ethereum testnet (Holesky): https://chainlist.org/chain/17000
- Taiko testnet (Hekla): https://chainlist.org/chain/167009

## Add mainnet tokens to your wallet

Find the token you want to import on the [mainnet addresses](/network-reference/mainnet-addresses) page and use the address to add it to your wallet.

## Add testnet tokens to your wallet

Find the token you want to import on the [testnet addresses](/network-reference/testnet-addresses) page and use the address to add it to your wallet.

## Troubleshooting

### The add buttons did not work

If the add buttons did not work, head over to the [RPC configuration](/network-reference/rpc-configuration) and [testnet addresses reference](/network-reference/testnet-addresses) or [mainnet addresses reference](/network-reference/mainnet-addresses) pages and add them to your wallet manually.
